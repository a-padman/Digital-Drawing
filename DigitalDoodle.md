# Digital Doodle 

## Description of Lesson:
    - This app will draw a line on the screen when the user drags their finger just like a sketch pad!

## Getting Started:
- From the My Projects page, click on New Project 
- Name your project *DigitalDoodle*
- Make sure the screen of your app does not move around when you are trying to draw! In order to do this, under your Canvas you should un-check the "Scrollable" setting. This will let your drawing canvas fill the whole screen without moving around.

### Create your Canvas 
- Step 1. From the Drawing and Animation tab, click and drag the Canvas to the viewer screen. This is where the user can draw on! 
- Step 2. Check the Canvas Check box on the Components section on the right side of the screen. Now it's time to change the size of the canvas. Change the Height and Width to "Fill Parent" to make the canvas take up the whole screen.

#### Coordinate Drawing Activity 
- On a piece of graphing paper, mark a few points in different spots so you can connect the dots.
- Connect the dots to show your picture and label each point on the graph with the (x,y) coordinate. 
- These points show you what the canvas does every time you draw a line in your app! It draws a line to connect the dots of different coordinate points. This happens really quickly, so it looks like you are drawing a picture!

### Block Editor Time:
- Go to the Blocks Editor to finish programming your app!
- In the Canvas1 drawer, pull out the Canvas1.Draw Line method block. Use the get and set CurrentX currentY buttons and snap them into the Canvas1.Draw Line method. This will draw a line every time to connect two points on the coordinate grid system! 

**Test it out :) Drag your finger around the screen and draw a picture**
